Dynamo is used to follow and support the evaluation by peers in working groups
The Dynamo tool is based on a peer evaluation of group dynamics. Each student is asked to evaluate the other members of his or her learning group on several dimensions (responsibility, expertise, attitude, etc.), and to evaluate himself or herself. These evaluations are then processed to
- provide teachers with indicators that allow them to diagnose at a glance which groups are in difficulty and which dimensions of collaboration need to be addressed
- objectify, on the basis of self and peer evaluations, the potential conflicts and the degree of commitment of each member in a group;
- provide teachers with tangible information, anchored in student assessments, to discuss with them any problems encountered in their group during the course of the work;
- offer teachers, on the basis of these same assessments, the possibility of weighting the collective work by an individual mark reflecting the contribution made by each student.
